    <h3>dear sir,</h3>
    <h1>re-character assassination as a political weapon</h1>
    <p class="paw">
        may i say that i <span>sympathise</span> with both correspondents
        who approve of character assassination as a political
        weapon and with those who do not. whether these stories are not
        the past is the past and should not be resurrected we 
        should judge public officers according to their present public 
        image and prsent public action, not with <span>references</span> to their past
        private lives as it they have no right to privacy at all 
    </p>
    <p class="paw"> may i point out, however,that it is a very dangerous weapon?
        for even though i appprove of character <span>assassination</span>,
        i am also aware of the risks involved in using it.for example,
        if you use it against someone who is able to disapprove your
        <span>allegations</span> you will only have destroyed your own <span>credibility</span>
        and i will have raised the reputations of your opponent. it
        seems that few politicians say to themselves,"i had better not
        that story about him in case he publishes this story about me!"
        indeed, i find it very surprising that many politicians employ
        this weapon  as if there are no dangerous to themselves in using it
    </p>
    <p class="paw"> however,i share the view already expressed that it is most unfair 
        to seek to damage your rival <span>reputations</span> by referring to unwise acts
        commited many years ago which have not been repeated since that time,
        it has been correctly pointed out that <span>accusations</span> like that can be 
        truthfully made against almost anyone.
        <p>so in conclusion may i say that,even though i agree that it is a <span>legiti
        mate</span> political weapon,i think it is one that ought to be used very <span>sparingly</span>
        if a candidate convices us that he is going to carry out the policies of
        our party, then he will have deserved our support when he stands for election
