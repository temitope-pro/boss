    <h1 class="header1">SIMILARITIES BETWEEN LET ,VAR AND CONST</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <ol>
            <li>Block Scope: All three can be used within a block (e.g., within {}), but their scoping rules differ. let
                and
                const are block-scoped, while var is function-scoped.
            </li>
            <li>Hoisting: All three declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope. However, while var
                can
                be
                used before it's declared (with an undefined value), let and const cannot be accessed before their
                declaration,
                resulting in a "temporal dead zone."
            </li>
            <li>Re-declaration: var allows re-declaration within the same scope, while let and const do not allow
                re-declaration in the same block scope.
            </li>
            <li>Variable Initialization: All three can be initialized at the time of declaration or later in the code.
                However, const requires an initializer at the time of declaration.
            </li>
            <li>Use in Global Scope: When declared in the global scope, all three can create properties on the global
                object
                (e.g., window in browsers). However, var creates a property, while let and const do not.

        </ol>

    <h1 class="header2">DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LET ,VAR AND CONST</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Scope:
                <ul>
                    <li> var: Function-scoped or globally scoped, meaning it is accessible throughout the entire
                        function
                        or
                        globally if declared outside any function.</li>
                    <li>let: Block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the nearest enclosing block (e.g.,
                        inside
                        {}).</li>
                    <li>const: Also block-scoped, similar to let.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li> Re-declaration:
                <ul>
                    <li>var: Allows re-declaration of the same variable within the same scope. </li>
                    <li>let: Does not allow re-declaration in the same block scope.</li>
                    <li>const: Does not allow re-declaration in the same block scope.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Initialization:
                <ul>
                    <li>var: Can be declared without initialization and can be assigned a value later.</li>
                    <li>let: Can also be declared without initialization and assigned a value later.</li>
                    <li>const: Must be initialized at the time of declaration; otherwise, it results in a syntax error.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Re-assignment:
                <ul>
                    <li> var: Can be re-assigned a new value after its initial assignment.</li>
                    <li> let: Can also be re-assigned a new value.</li>
                    <li> const: Cannot be re-assigned; once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed (though properties
                        of
                        objects
                        assigned to a const can be mutated).</li>

    <h1 class="header3">SHORT HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT (ECMA SCRIPT 1) TO (ES6)</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="text">
            JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape. The first edition of ECMAScript
            (ES1) was standardized in June 1997 to provide a consistent scripting language for web development. ES2
            followed in 1998, focusing on minor updates and maintenance.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            In 1999, ES3 introduced significant features like regular expressions, try/catch, and more robust string
            manipulation. After a long hiatus, ES4 was proposed but ultimately abandoned due to complexity and
            disagreement among stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            In 2009, ES5 was released, adding "strict mode," JSON support, and new array methods. This revitalized
            interest in JavaScript. Finally, in 2015, ES6 (or ECMAScript 2015) arrived, introducing major enhancements
            such as classes, modules, arrow functions, and promises, solidifying JavaScriptâ€™s status as a powerful and
            versatile language for modern web development.
